/*We started out by creating a react app
using npx create react app. Then we did git init
in order to initalize repo. Then we are downloading
dependencies we will need. First one is:
npm install react-router-dom react-icons --save uuid 
Next we deleted app.css and we deleted what was in the react div in app.js. we imported  { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom"; Then we added browserrouter tags in our return statement so it would return h1 element of our name. */
